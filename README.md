## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Pip package manager

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/performx.git
   cd performx
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up your Gemini API key** (two options)

   **Option A:** Create a `.streamlit/secrets.toml` file:
   ```toml
   GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-gemini-api-key"
   ```

   **Option B:** Enter your API key in the application when prompted

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```
   
   For version without AI features:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app_without_gemini.py
   ```

5. **Open the application**
   
   Navigate to http://localhost:8501 in your web browser

## üìä Data Format

PerformX works with any CSV file containing employee performance data. While it automatically adapts to different formats, optimal results come from files with:

- An employee identifier column
- Performance metric columns (numeric values)
- Optional time-based columns for trend analysis

### Sample Data Structure
```
employee_id,name,department,role,performance_score,sales_target,sales_achieved,...
E001,John Smith,Sales,Senior Associate,78,100000,95000,...
E002,Emily Johnson,Marketing,Manager,85,80000,92000,...
```

## üîß Configuration Options

### Display Options
- **Simple Table**: Clean, straightforward data presentation
- **Highlight Top Performers**: Emphasize your team's strongest contributors
- **Color-Coded Table**: Visualize performance levels with color intensity

### Analysis Controls
- Filter data by department, role, or time period
- Select specific metrics for focused analysis
- Adjust visualization parameters for customized views

## üîç Use Cases

- **Performance Reviews**: Gather objective data for employee evaluations
- **Team Assessment**: Understand overall team performance and dynamics
- **Improvement Planning**: Develop targeted strategies for team enhancement
- **Resource Allocation**: Identify where training or support is most needed
- **Succession Planning**: Recognize high performers for advancement opportunities
